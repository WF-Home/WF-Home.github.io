# Github Pages Challenge

## Introduction

I made this repo to teach my friend how to create a static page using github pages. This repo is just an example of a simple page that I want him to work with before diving further into Front End Development

You can check out this sample page [here](https://wf-home.github.io/)


## Setup

- Create a new repo named <your_username>.github.io this will make is so that github will deploy your page everytime you push new code.
- Create and index.md, this will serve as your index.html. <br>
**Note:** You dont need to specify the doctype for this 
- Create a file called _config.yml that contains the following:

    ```yml
    name: <text that you want to display for the browser tab>
    title: null
    ```

Setting title as null will remove the default header that github uses for your page.


## Instructions

1. Create a header with your name on it.
2. Add a circular photo of anything.
3. Create sections of information regarding yourself.
4. Add a section for skills that you have.
5. Create a navigation bar to go through the different sections of your page.
6. Design your page however you want. Have fun!

**Constraints:** 
- Only use css and html for this challenge. 
- Use a stylesheet for all your styling, do not put your design specifications directly on your html elements.
